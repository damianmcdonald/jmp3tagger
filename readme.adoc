`jmp3tagger` is a http://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current/reference/html/shell.html[Spring Shell] command line application that can read and write the ID3 tags from mp3 files.

The application is not much more than a wrapper over the http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/[jaudiotagger] library.

It was created for a specific usecase and may not prove particulary useful to others however the application could be easily modified and it does provide a good reference point for the use of Spring Shell and jaudiotagger.

The application was created to bulk tag a specific mp3 collection in which the folder structure was well known and formed the basis of the tagging logic.

The application expects a folder structure as follows, where `album_art.jpg` is a cover image for the album:
